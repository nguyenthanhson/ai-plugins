# Atlassian Tools

## Overview

Read-only Atlassian access via a custom MCP server providing Jira issue retrieval, JQL search, Confluence page reading, CQL search, and attachment downloads. All operations are read-only — the server never creates, updates, or deletes any Atlassian resource.

## Installation

Configure the following environment variables:

```bash
# Required — Atlassian Cloud ID (find yours at https://your-domain.atlassian.net/_edge/tenant_info)
export ATLASSIAN_CLOUD_ID="your-cloud-id"
export ATLASSIAN_EMAIL="your-email@company.com"
export ATLASSIAN_JIRA_READ_ONLY_TOKEN="your-jira-scoped-token"
export ATLASSIAN_CONFLUENCE_READ_ONLY_TOKEN="your-confluence-scoped-token"
```

API requests are routed through the Atlassian API gateway (`api.atlassian.com`), which supports both classic and scoped API tokens.

### Required Atlassian Permissions

Use **scoped (granular) API tokens** for least-privilege access. Create them at [id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens). Scoped tokens require the API gateway (`api.atlassian.com`) and your Cloud ID.

| `get_issue` | Read a Jira issue by key or ID |
| `search_issues` | Search issues using JQL |
| `get_issue_comments` | Get comments for an issue |
| `get_issue_remote_links` | Get remote links for an issue (Confluence pages, PRs, external URLs) |
| `list_projects` | List accessible Jira projects |
| `download_attachment` | Download a Jira attachment as Base64 |

### Confluence

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |

## Usage

The MCP tools are available as `mcp__atlassian__<tool_name>`. Examples:

- Read an issue: `mcp__atlassian__get_issue` with `issueIdOrKey: "PROJ-123"`
- Search with JQL: `mcp__atlassian__search_issues` with `jql: "project = PROJ AND status = Open"`
- Read a Confluence page: `mcp__atlassian__get_confluence_page` with `pageId: "123456789"`
- Search Confluence: `mcp__atlassian__search_confluence_cql` with `cql: "space = EN AND text ~ \"search term\""`

## Skills

### `researching-jira-issues`

Orchestrates a deep read of a Jira issue by traversing linked issues, remote links, and supporting Confluence documentation, then synthesizing everything into a structured summary. Triggered by mentioning a Jira issue key with intent to understand it deeply (e.g., "Read PROJ-123", "What's blocking PROJ-123?").

Features:

- Graph traversal with depth control (2 hops) and cycle detection
- Next-gen epic children discovery via JQL
- Automatic Confluence page follow-through from remote links
- Context budget guidance and graceful degradation

## Requirements

- Claude Code with MCP support
- Atlassian API credentials (see Installation)
